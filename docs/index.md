# What is TetroNet?
TetroNet is an AI that can play a tetromino falling block game. Or... maybe it can? With enough training?

# How do I install and run it?
* You must have a 64-bit version of Python!

1. You'd first need an installation of Python 3.7
2. Then install PyGame by running `python -m pip install -U pygame --user`.
3. After that, install NumPy by running `python -m pip install numpy`.
4. Don't forget to install Keras! `python -m pip install keras`
5. Finally, install Tensorflow. This'll take a bit. `python -m pip install tensorflow`

Then just run `tetroNet.py`, and watch the AI fail over and over again!

# How do I configure it?
We're working on that.
